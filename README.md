# Code Examples Repository

This repository serves as a central hub for all the **code examples** featured in my blog posts and YouTube videos. Each project here is designed to illustrate a specific concept in **Spring Boot**, **Apache Camel**, and other technologies related to **software integration** and **backend development**.

## üìå Projects Overview

### 1. [**weather-processor**](/weather-processor/)

- A **data pipeline** built with **Apache Camel**.
- Processes weather data from an external API and applies transformations before storing it.
- Demonstrates **data routing, integration patterns, and real-world ETL processing**.

### 2. [**spring-boot-filters-interceptors**](/spring-boot-filters-interceptors/)
- A **Spring Boot** project that showcases the differences between **Servlet Filters** and **Spring Interceptors**.
- Includes examples of **request logging, authentication, API rate limiting**, and more.
- Helps developers understand when to use **Filters vs. Interceptors** effectively.

## üí° How to Use
Each project is self-contained. You can clone this repository and explore the code to deepen your understanding of **Spring Boot, Apache Camel, OAuth2 and integration patterns**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
The code in this repository is **intended for educational purposes only** and serves as a reference for explaining concepts. These examples **are not optimized for production** and may lack proper performance considerations, security measures, and thorough testing. 

üìå **Do not copy-paste these examples directly into production systems** without a strong analysis and necessary improvements.

## üöÄ Stay Updated
New projects will be added regularly! Stay tuned for more advanced **Spring Boot**, **API security**, and **software integration** examples.
